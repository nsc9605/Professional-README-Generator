  ## Description
   This application aims to assist developers with a template design to create a professional, quality README.md file in an efficient and clean way. When the application runs, it presents a series of prompts for the user to answer that will help build a proper README.md file. The user is taken step by step through each section that a README should have for each application--ensuring they never forget important sections! The user will be asked to provide the following:

   * Name of their project
   * Detailed description of the project
   * Installation requirements to run the project
   * How the application should be used
   * Select a license from the given options
   * List any collaborators with github username (if any)
   * How to test the application
   * Github username
   * Email address

   This information is then used to fill out the Professional README Generator template provided by the generatedMarkdown file. This newly generated README is then saved in the demo folder.
