  ## Description
   This application aims to assist developers with a template design to create a professional, quality README.md file in an efficient and clean way. This prompts the user to answer a set of questions/information that will help build a proper README.md file. The user is taken step by step through each section a README should have for each application--ensuring they never forget important sections! The user will be asked to provide the following:

   * Name of their project
   * Detailed description of the project
   * Installation requirements to run the project
   * How the application should be used
   * Select a license from the given options
   * List any collaborators with github username (if any)
   * How to test the application
   * Github username
   * Email address

   This information is then used to fill out the Professional README Generator template provided by the generatedMarkdown file.
